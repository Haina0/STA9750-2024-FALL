## **1. Introduction**

**Motivating Question:**\
*"How do year-over-year EV adoption growth rates differ across states, and what are the key factors influencing these trends?"*

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption has become a critical indicator of how prepared states are for the future of sustainable transportation. By analyzing growth trends, we can identify which states are adapting quickly, what drives their success, and where improvements can be made.

**Relevance to the Overarching Question:**\
This analysis directly supports our team's overarching question: *"Which states are adapting to electric vehicles the best?"* California emerged as the leading state due to its strong EV adoption rates, and this report provides a deeper look at the trends and factors behind this success.

**Importance of EV Growth Trends:**\
- EV adoption helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat climate change, and improve air quality.\
- Understanding adoption trends allows policymakers to replicate successful strategies across states.\
- Highlighting key factors influencing growth can inform future infrastructure investments and policy designs.

## **2. Methodology**

This report synthesizes insights from publicly available trends and simulated datasets to illustrate year-over-year EV growth. While specific real-world datasets are unavailable for this project, code examples demonstrate how such data could be analyzed and visualized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Key Findings and Visualizations**

### **3.1. Year-Over-Year Growth Trends**

The following example demonstrates how growth trends across states could be calculated and visualized using EV adoption data.

```{r}
# Simulated Data for EV Growth
library(tidyverse)

ev_data <- tibble(
  State = rep(c("California", "Texas", "Florida"), each = 5),
  Year = rep(2017:2021, times = 3),
  EV_Count = c(500000, 600000, 720000, 860000, 1000000, 
               100000, 150000, 210000, 280000, 360000, 
               50000, 80000, 120000, 160000, 210000)
)

# Calculate Year-over-Year Growth
processed_data <- ev_data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  arrange(Year) %>%
  mutate(YoY_Growth = (EV_Count - lag(EV_Count)) / lag(EV_Count) * 100)

processed_data
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3.2. Visualizing Growth Trends**

The visualization below highlights growth trends for each state over time.

```{r}
# Line Plot of Year-over-Year Growth Trends
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(processed_data, aes(x = Year, y = YoY_Growth, color = State)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "Year-Over-Year EV Growth Trends by State",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Growth Rate (%)",
       color = "State") +
  theme_minimal()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3.3. Infrastructure and Policy Impact**

Charging infrastructure and state policies play critical roles in EV adoption. The simulated example below illustrates how charging station density might correlate with adoption growth.

```{r}
# Simulated Data for Charging Stations and Growth
infra_data <- tibble(
  State = c("California", "Texas", "Florida"),
  Charging_Stations = c(15000, 7000, 5000),
  YoY_Growth = c(25, 22, 20)
)

# Scatter Plot of Charging Stations vs. Growth
ggplot(infra_data, aes(x = Charging_Stations, y = YoY_Growth, color = State)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Impact of Charging Infrastructure on EV Growth",
       x = "Number of Charging Stations",
       y = "Year-over-Year Growth (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Discussion and Insights**

### **Key Takeaways:**

1.  **State Policies:** Generous tax credits and mandates (e.g., Zero-Emission Vehicle standards) significantly influence adoption rates.
2.  **Infrastructure:** Well-distributed charging networks correlate strongly with growth.
3.  **Economic Trends:** Lower-GDP states show potential for growth with targeted incentives.

### **Limitations:**

-   Simulated data may not reflect all real-world complexities.
-   Additional factors such as cultural preferences and federal policies could further impact trends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5. Conclusion**

This analysis underscores California's leadership in EV adoption, driven by strong policies, infrastructure investments, and a robust market size. Emerging states like Texas and Florida demonstrate the potential for growth when supported by targeted strategies.
